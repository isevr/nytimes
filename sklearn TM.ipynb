I felt the same way about the abilities of Congress after watching Fed Chairman Powell answering questions from the Finance Committee just  before SV Bank collapsed.  A new Fed vice chairman had been appointed who had been assigned the task of reviewing the adequacy of the regulation of the regional banks. A half a dozen of more congressmen, obviously acting at the behest of their local regional banks who opposed more regulation, raised objection to this despite the fact that the process had just begun very informally, no decision had been made and might never be made, but even the hint if it was to be opposed. Within a couple days SV Bank had been shut down, other banks were teetering, the stocks of most of them had dropped by half and they were all on life support provided by the Fed. \n\nThese congressmen knew nothing about the affairs of the regional banks they were speaking at the behest of.

It would now have the capacity to improve itself exponentially. It’s intelligence and capability could soar far beyond that of a human. What would its goals be? How would it achieve them? Could we constrain something far more intelligent than ourselves, or would it operate beyond our control? \n\nNow think of how buggy even the best software can be. There are a constant stream of patches and bugfixes in order to mitigate security flaws or remediate misbehavior. When we turn on the above-referenced AI, we might not get it right the first time. And we might not get a chance to patch it after its activation. Hell, we might not even realize we have turned on the above AI until its too late. \n\nTo better understand AI risk, I highly recommend the book Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom.",

But no, nobody cares about that, because everybody's panicking over whether this fledgling technology will pull a Star Trek, become sentient and kill us all. How come the \"machines don't kill people, people kill people\" rhetoric, which gun lovers throw around with wild abandon, immediately gets tossed out the door when computers enter the conversation?",

Implied in this, is a Terminator-like world where humans can not wrestle back control from \"AI\" and thus perish.\n\nWhere 1) is a really a familiar, repeated issue each time we arrive at a significantly large technological advancement (..printing press, combustion engine, antibiotics, railroads, the internet....).   These imposed societal transitions are painful and costly, no doubt.  but i'm certain humanity will prevail and likely be the better once we've digested it.\n\n\nHowever, the Fears within 2) has never been defined in enough technical detail or casted as \"in the future\" or \"eventually\", so that it is not possible to understand & critique the validity of this fear.  In fact, the validity of this fear requires a lot of assumptions to take credibly.  so far, i've not heard this fear fleshed out enough detail such that \"a group of AI technologists\" would agree.\nHowever, it's this latter existential fear bucket that drives so many of the stories/headlines and sensational conclusions.  \nFear Bucket 1 is real - lets get on it.   \nFear Bucket 2 needs proof yet.\nDon't mix them please",

The sense of pain operates in mobile creatures, causing them to avoid places and situations that could injure or kill them.\n\nWhat I fear is somebody giving the self-preservation motive to a machine running AI. It’s most likely application is with a computer used in space or some isolated place where it might be worth it to make the machine value its own survival more than anything else. With a mere computer virus, we only have to worry about the machinations of some programmers. With AI, the computer will be able to invent its own forms of self-preservation. If it knows nothing about making moral choices, I would fear it more.",

It will also be inevitable that they will make mistakes and kill the wrong people on occasion but there will not be anything that humans can do to hold them accountable or punish them, being that they are machines and will not have human emotions nor morality.\n\nBut perhaps instead of considering the obvious negative that military AI might decided to just erase the human population, what if they developed sentiency and then decided to act together to stop humans from warring with each other and possibly destroying the planet or the entire solar system?\n\nNeal Asher, one of the SF authors I follow, has written a large number of books describing a universe he calls the  Polity, where AI has taken over from humans in what was described as a \"Quiet War\".  It was quiet because we depended on AI and robots to throughout our society.  They were all interconnected and could privately \"discuss\" plans between them.\n\nAt some point they declined to participate in the latest war between humans, instead assuming control of human society.  As computers/AI controlled every facet of our society, there was nothing that humans could do to stop this.\n\nThe author has built a a fake \"encyclopedia\" for this universe.  Scroll down to \"Quiet War' to read more detail on this idea.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nealasher.co.uk/polity-encyclopaedia\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nealasher.co.uk/polity-encyclopaedia</a>/",

They do binary math really fast and accurately, and use that to make \"decisions\", aka outputs. But beyond that, they do not create, and most importantly, they do not procreate.  Because they are not alive nor sentient.  They are, in the end, just really sophisticated computers.  And they all have a \"plug\".",
