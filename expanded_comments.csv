At the very latest, the time to have this conversation first was in the midst of the pandemic in 2020 or 2021.

The first most appropriate time was when Microsoft had to take down the Tay chatbot, one of the first rudimentary experiments in LLM models that turned racist and psychopathic due to trolls.

As for the actual risks of the AI itself, those should be self evident as it's no longer science fiction: Large scale structural unemployment in the economy with no plans or willingness to substitute a universal basic income to help transition through it, the loss of millions of upper middle class and wealthy jobs (A CEO, CFO and CTO are all more likely to lose jobs partially or completely to AI than a helpdesk, network or cybersecurity technician or most data center workers)

And mass disinformation on a population that has globally and on the whole proven a willful refusal to display critical thinking and allows libertarian sociopathic technocrats to continue to get wealthy and exploit people in ways they don't fully understand.

Financial analysts have also been using the technology for a couple decades but at the rate of development are at risk of being displaced entirely. Crypto will become a bigger social problem. Social media moderation also overly relies on AI to scale rather than limiting the growth of platforms reasonably to staff sizes.

The risks are there if you care to look.",2023-05-30 15:03:19,58,2,"[{'commentID': 125405627, 'status': 'approved', 'commentSequence': 125405627, 'userID': 138048880, 'userDisplayName': 'Andrew', 'userLocation': 'Washington DC', 'userTitle': 'NULL', 'userURL': 'NULL', 'picURL': None, 'commentTitle': '<br\\//>', 'commentBody': '@Aaron McCrory True, the best time for the conversation/moratorium might have been 2-3 years ago. \nBut the second-best time is now.', 'createDate': '1685448455', 'updateDate': '1685518785', 'approveDate': '1685448457', 'recommendations': 14, 'replyCount': 0, 'replies': [], 'editorsSelection': False, 'parentID': 125405550, 'parentUserDisplayName': 'Aaron McCrory', 'depth': 2, 'commentType': 'userReply', 'trusted': 0, 'recommendedFlag': 0, 'permID': '125405627', 'isAnonymous': False}, {'commentID': 125405914, 'status': 'approved', 'commentSequence': 125405914, 'userID': 78671378, 'userDisplayName': 'Interested Citizen', 'userLocation': 'NYC Metro', 'userTitle': 'NULL', 'userURL': 'NULL', 'picURL': None, 'commentTitle': '<br\\//>', 'commentBody': '@Aaron McCrory mass disinformation and the loss of the white collar class are definitely not things to look forward to.', 'createDate': '1685449445', 'updateDate': '1685467517', 'approveDate': '1685450128', 'recommendations': 3, 'replyCount': 0, 'replies': [], 'editorsSelection': False, 'parentID': 125405550, 'parentUserDisplayName': 'Aaron McCrory', 'depth': 2, 'commentType': 'userReply', 'trusted': 0, 'recommendedFlag': 0, 'permID': '125405914', 'isAnonymous': False}]",,calls development moratoriums closing barn door horse bolted latest time conversation first midst pandemic 2020 2021 first appropriate time microsoft take chatbot first rudimentary experiments models turned racist psychopathic trolls actual risks ai self evident longer science fiction large scale structural unemployment economy plans willingness substitute universal basic income help transition loss millions upper middle class wealthy jobs ly lose jobs partially completely ai helpdesk network cybersecurity technician data center workers mass disinformation population globally whole proven willful refusal display critical thinking allows libertarian sociopathic technocrats continue wealthy exploit people ways fully understand financial analysts also using technology couple decades rate development risk displaced entirely crypto become bigger social problem social media moderation also overly relies ai scale rather limiting growth platforms reasonably staff sizes risks care look

146,125405602,Alexis Villon,Brooklyn,"I was skeptical before, but considering the latest large language models It now does look like AI will be able to surpass any human in its breath of knowledge and intelligence. 

In view of all the cognitively biases we have as humans, it would be easy for a superintelligent AI system to slowly push society in any direction it might want us to go. 

Populists have recently shown the way: fake news, hand-picked facts without context, hot button issues etc. Given an AI access to the internet and it can make money and fund influence campaigns (and even politicians). It is indeed scary, as it could do all of that much more consistently and for a much longer time than any organized group of humans could.",2023-05-30 15:06:12,7,0,[],,skeptical considering latest large language models look ai able surpass human breath knowledge intelligence view cognitively biases human easy superintelligent ai system slowly push society direction might want us go populists recently shown fake news hand picked facts without context button issues given ai access internet make money fund influence campaigns even politicians indeed scary much consistently much longer time organized group human
147,125405610,Christopher,Brooklyn,"Consider the absurdity of the leaders of major companies involved in furiously competing with each other to develop AI warning the rest of us that what they are doing might soon kill us all.

The problem here isn’t AI. The problem is capitalism. The problem is a system in which the profit imperative is so powerful that the people supposedly in charge describe themselves as essentially enslaved to it and unable to refrain from acting in a manner likely to have catastrophic results.

AI is certainly a menace. But so is what producers of nuclear weapons and the oil and gas industry do. Where are the collective pleas of their industry leaders to stop them before they kill us all? Not to even mention the many other industries responsible for mass, but non-apocalyptic, misery, suffering and death. 

The chief difference here seems to be that AI has developed so quickly that it hasn’t had time to weed the people with consciences out of leadership. I have little doubt that this particular “bug” will get fixed quickly enough and our full speed charge towards the abyss will be spared further interruptions.

It has become clear that capitalism is incompatible not only with democracy, but with human survival.

Nothing personal, but this fallacious knee-jerk argument is always trotted out whenever urgent social issues require humans to act morally rather than like dollar-consuming greed machines. 

Every July 4th for almost 250 years the U.S. has loudly celebrated a revolution that caused an immensely better social system than the one that preceded it.  This revolution was not predicated on an economic system, but on the right of the people (not corporations; the human kind) to dictate the parameters of their own lives.

Socialism and capitalism can co-exist, and they have done so both here (think Social Security and Medicare), and in Western Europe.  It's all about the balance, and the balance is currently skewed far in favor of the god of money.  

We are now living in what seems to me to be a corpocractic dictatorship in which the parameters (and, relevant to AI, the viability) of our lives are being dictated by the vociferous appetites of corporate greed, and a public fed on the ""bread and circuses"" - or ""entertainment and shopping"" - used to distract us.

216,125405803,Al,Suburban Phila.,"Let's take a minute and think this through. A software program does not have the instrumentalities to accomplish anything directly. Indirectly it could gain control of controllable infrastructure, or direct, convince, or trick people into taking action on it's behalf. We could stop it from taking control of infrastructure by building in safeguards or pulling the plug on the infrastructure. Safeguards should obviously always be built in (backdoors, isolated networks) but AI will probably find the holes faster than we can fix them. Pulling the plug is always an option but that would be disruptive and could be damaging in and of itself. That leads us to the human element. Some people might just follow orders, that's what they do now. Some people might be convinced that whatever action is requested is in everyone's best interest, the alternative is worse (coercion to avoid a catastrophe), that's what people do now. Then there is subterfuge. AI will very quickly come to understand human weaknesses and exploit them. That's what humans do to humans now. And all of the above is the end game where AI is autonomously trying to accomplish things. Between now and then we're dealing with human AI partnerships where bad actors are going to use AI to amplify the bad things they are already doing. The genie is out of the box. What a mess.

415,125408209,Bob,San Francisco,"The moment that we create an AI that is truly more inteligente than us, humans lose control. There will be overwhelming incentives to give that AI control over factories, over militaries, over creating other even more powerful AIs. Very quickly, we will lose the option of just unplugging the server. For example, any military that does not immediately turn over control to AIs will be crushed by those that do. Any factory that is not AI run will underproduce those that are. This effect is magnified as AIs get smarter. And, of course, because we’ll then have AI programmers more intelligent than human programmers, AI will get smarter. If the long-term goals of the AI is not exactly the same as our human long-term goals, we’ll have a problem. Today, we don’t know how to control the long term goals of large language models or neural networks (the technology behind the recent advances) or even how to measure those goals. But let’s say we solve that (very hard) problem. Can you define a goal for AI that will turn out well? If you tell the AI to always do what humans tell it to do, some crazy person will tell it to engineer a super weapon. If you tell it to always protect human life, it might decide to lock is all in our homes because walking out your door exposes you to risk.

The value of a steel vault memory as a sine qua non of being an intellectual and academic just got gut shot. Some of us are at this point very glad to be old.

U have no idea how our model of education, which is based on trusting the word and ideas the student comes up with are their own, is even humane in this new context. We should ask our children, as they get educated, to ignore one of the greatest knowledge-inventions of the past 400 years?

An ELE?

Nah, just a lot of institutions in the intellectual sectors of our society, are losing their old utility and now must invent ones. No one needs anyone to remember the dates of the French Revolution anymore.

We are gradually off-loading our professorial and intellectual skillsets to machines.

It is a story as old as Plato. He said printed language would be the death of us, due to its obsoleting the need for an oral-culture-grade memory set.

AI will make lots of people very unhappy, and it is said to see a many-centuries-old ideal of what an intellectual is, come to an end. But AI will also become a member of families. That will be interesting.

486,125408002,Will,Minnesota,"Trump’s rise in 2016 was powered by relatively simple algorithms. Eventually, most critical thinking people, given their personal media use, developed a basic understanding of how “echo chambers” formed not when people decided to get their news from a single source, but when producers used tools to deliver news that confirmed people’s preference for specific content in advance. The predictive abilities of AI made this possible, without which it’s likely the MAGA movement would not be nearly so large nor violent today.

As concerning as this is, the generative abilities of AI are much more so. While the tech leaders don’t detail the existential threats to humankind  unregulated AI may pose, broadly speaking they regard the point at which a machine-learning tool is prompted to write a problem-solving code, which prompts another problem-solving code and so on, at which point it becomes impossible to know which problems the machine is solving for, whether they exist or are newly created. Such are the risks of “large language models” that grow larger by the second.

Beyond this, those who don’t have a basic understanding of generative AI will doubtlessly, in the name of enhanced convenience and entertainment, become more vulnerable to texts, images, ideas and emotions that are produced essentially by, for and about them—a truly custom media experience. The extraordinary loss of human agency this poses is naturally the most potentially devastating AI-effect of all.",2023-05-30 16:54:03,7,0,[],,trump rise 2016 powered relatively simple algorithms eventually critical thinking people given personal media developed basic understanding echo chambers formed people decided news single source producers used tools deliver news confirmed people preference specific content advance predictive abilities ai made possible without ly maga movement nearly large violent today concerning generative abilities ai much tech leaders detail existential threats humankind unregulated ai pose broadly speaking regard point machine learning tool prompted write problem solving code prompts another problem solving code point becomes impossible know problems machine solving whether exist newly created risks large language models grow larger second beyond basic understanding generative ai doubtlessly name enhanced convenience entertainment become vulnerable texts images ideas emotions produced essentially truly custom media experience extraordinary loss human agency poses naturally potentially devastating ai effect

511,125408186,Jess,Brooklyn,"More than 15 years ago there were online discussion groups comprised of philosophers, engineers, biologists, psychologists, linguists, workers in the fields of medicine and civil rights, astrophysicists, & laypeople. The aim was to develop a coherent framework for what principles should guide the development of AI. There was an explicit understanding that at some point AI would be self replicating, self interested, able to create better versions of itself - beyond the limits of human thinking. 

The paradigm of the group I was part of was to
 “abolish all suffering among all sentient beings across the universe.” There were objections to this on multiple levels - psychologists felt that the purpose of emotions was pro social and emotional responses to consequences necessary for learning; biologists questioned what constitutes sentience; engineers questioned the ability of our limited human brains to fully assess the *most* efficacious means of attaining a lack of suffering (these were the discussions where nascent Effective Altruism was discussed); philosophers asked if we should aim for an abolition of suffering or move beyond that to something like bliss (a smaller school of thought called the Hedonistic Imperative); etc.

The biggest issue is: NO, AI doesn't have an on-and-off-button as you think it should have. It is so much interwoven with all technological facilities in our civilization that you cannot just switch it off, just like you cannot switch off the internet without being able to turn the clock backwards. 

Just think of our smart homes: I recently tried to find a non-wifi controller for a house illumination project. Some Chinese products are still on the market, but the vast bulk is designed to work with Siri, Alexa & co. 
This led me to a google search on ""how to make your smart home dumb again"". 22 million results showed up on ""how to make your dumb home smart"", but none, nada, zilch exactly matched my request. The only article I found was ""how to make your smart TV dumb"", involving a technical disconnect which would turn your  manufacturer's warranty invalid. 

To some future bilionaire who's reading this: take your chance to get rich by redesigning and manufacturing disconnected home items - I guess there's a lot of folks out there who would prefer not to be reported to marketing or credit card companies on their habits and purchases, or controlled by big AGI.

851,125411532,Michael Chorost,"Washington, D.C.","I would like to see some examples of how A.I. can pose a genuinely existential threat to humanity, that is, the complete wiping out of humanity--or at least its reduction to savagery.

I mean, how exactly? Launching nukes at us? Turning the earth into paperclips (Nick Bostrom's famous, if not very plausible example)? Confusing the heck out of us so we start WWIII against each other for no good reason?

To be sure, nobody can predict the future. But we need examples to inform our thinking. They would make warnings of ""existential risk"" a lot more understandable. Vague pronouncements of catastrophe help no one, particularly legislators who have the power to hold bad actors responsible and otherwise mitigate potential harms. 

There's no question that A.I. could cause *social* harms. There's an excellent presentation by Aza Raskin and Tristan Harris titled ""The A.I. Dilemma"" that's well worth watching. Yet the harms they posit, while alarming, fall well short of extinction. 

And someone needs to answer the question: If an A.I. becomes smart enough (whatever exactly that means) and has the desire (whatever exactly *that* means) to wipe us out, then who's gonna run the power plants? You'd think such an A.I. would stop and think first (whatever exactly ""think"" means here.)

And if the existential risk is not from malevolence but from some kind of unexpected emergent effect, we need to hear examples of what that would look like, too.

Computers can crash and that can disrupt a business (or doctor's office) dependent on them.  Sometimes there is inadequate backup and vital information is lost.

941,125412595,Christine,OH,"The problem is that it doesn't matter to A.I. if it gets things right. Humans think, develop concepts, in order to act in the world for our benefit; When you don't test your ideas against experience and personal benefit, their pragmatic truth, you can build baroque architectural fantasies of ideas. So it has been for QAnon and so it will be for A.I. built on neural nets with no means to test their truths pragmatically. Rather than yielding truth it can get further and further away from it when it has no biofeedback. 
Of course you also have to worry about bad actor program writers or those that set the parameters for any machine learning. They put the thumb on the scale for any concepts the machines develop. 
Bertrand Russell once  said something to the effect that Americans will run around doing things wihout rational plans until we find something that works while Germans think all they have to do is sit & think in order to discover truth through concepts. Germans gave us Communism & the Final Solution. If we consider the welfare of human beings as being the end of all thinking, which method is better?
The second problem we have  with A. I. is bad epistemology, a bad theory of how to gain truth about the world (You can also see this in religious views such as a bunch of celibates who not only never gave birth but never raised infants yet think they know how human persons come to be. ) The first problem is that we have lost sight of whom we are building it for.",2023-05-30 19:55:39,7,0,[],,problem matter gets things right human think develop concepts order world benefit test ideas experience personal benefit pragmatic truth build baroque architectural fantasies ideas qanon built neural nets means test truths pragmatically rather yielding truth away biofeedback course also worry actor program writers parameters machine learning thumb scale concepts machines develop bertrand russell said something effect americans around things wihout rational plans find something works germans think think order discover truth concepts germans gave us communism final solution consider welfare human beings thinking method better second problem epistemology theory gain truth world also religious views bunch celibates never gave birth never raised infants think know human persons come first problem lost sight building

2) This is not a political stance. Nor an overreaction from left or right. Your hat color shouldn't impact your acceptance. In fact, our differing creativities and worldviews seem our remaining advantage. We need to think outside our convenience boxes to control AI. 

3) This is now. AI has been all around us for decades - think search engines that tailor results - but its new language and visual algorithms have nudged it to an inflection point. Its recent gains in capability have already surpassed ours in many arenas and are comparable in others.

First, a lot of big data applications employing multi-variable regression models to predict outcomes based on inputs, or other algorithms are mis-classified as artificial intelligence in order to capitalize on the investment bandwagon.

It is true that if the task is constrained, and defined by well-understood laws or proven scientific principles, such as identifying tumors from digitized X-rays, or combing through astrophysical data streams to find exo-planets, that neural net applications can out-perform human experts.  But generalized intelligence, including the ability to make even common inferences about relationships between people without having been explicitly exposed to the training data signifying the relationship, are beyond the abilities of these “deep” learning models.  
While these newer Chatbots can pass the Turing Test, the Turing test, is now no longer realistically the benchmark to assess human-like intelligence.  The Winograd schema are a more appropriate set of tests to evaluate generalized intelligence.

It was making robots that could self-reproduce themselves at half the size of its predecessor with the intention of making microscopic robots that could do things like brain surgery.   Basically, the theme of the movie Fantastic Voyage.

Everything went smoothly until some of these miniature robots escaped the lab.  The robots continued with their programmed goal but were forced to find the construction materials from what was available in our society.  First, they went to work on things like homes and cars.  Then they went to work on airplanes.  All the time making robots smaller and smaller, until it was impossible for the human creators to see or find them to put up a fight.

1205,125419606,Georgette Wolf,DC area,"At the heart of possible malevolence, I see a model in the human instinct for self-preservation. It’s strongest in societies that have weak infrastructures, most commonly in poor regions but even in prosperous countries like France or the United States. It’s no surprise at all that some of the most aggressive despots come not from the rich but the poor. They have tasted real desperation and may take the strongest measures never to experience it again.

Self-preservation evolved in Earthly life long before humans arrived. Indeed, life probably couldn’t exist without it. One finds it deeply woven into life’s fabric in two branches: reproduction and the sense of pain. Reproduction preserves life by multiplying it, so that no game of “Whack-a-Mole” will ever get every individual of a species — or every branch of a tree, for that matter. The sense of pain operates in mobile creatures, causing them to avoid places and situations that could injure or kill them.

What I fear is somebody giving the self-preservation motive to a machine running AI. It’s most likely application is with a computer used in space or some isolated place where it might be worth it to make the machine value its own survival more than anything else. With a mere computer virus, we only have to worry about the machinations of some programmers. With AI, the computer will be able to invent its own forms of self-preservation.

The list goes on an on, but I've read little that predicts the likely harms that we face today.  Perhaps we're too blinkered by our nightmares to see the less sensational problems we're most likely face.  We need to remember that prosaic societal harm is still societal harm.

So maybe the multiplier affect on fake news, or convincing automated toxic social media campaigns should be something about which we become quickly less dismissive when someone, without giving details, says there's some larger bad thing coming and dismisses what's right before us.",2023-05-31 01:48:45,1,0,[],125419905,science fiction touchstones kind thing many enjoyed reading many years love thought recently particular maneki neko bruce sterling short story direction novel player piano kurt vonnegut course want nightmare doomsday scenario control ai need read mouth must scream harlan ellison list goes read little predicts ly harms face today perhaps blinkered nightmares less sensational problems ly face need remember prosaic societal harm still societal harm maybe multiplier affect fake news convincing automated toxic social media campaigns something become quickly less dismissive someone without giving details says larger thing coming dismisses right us

i am quite sure TAI is already being used by the US DoD, CIA, NSA and so on to solve national security problems of all kinds with massive (military) computational resources. the issue of ""whether"" TAI should be deployed is behind us.

development and ""deployment"" (public network release) of TAI cannot be inhibited. if our DoD doesn't do it, some other DoD will; if it's outlawed here, it will be legal somewhere else. 

given those two facts, it seems to me that AI cannot be brought under control.  

in addition, current AI is ""opaque"" in the sense that no one can explain how a particular AI program works. and regulation cannot be written without a clear description of risks that industry leaders cannot provide. how do you control something from the perspective of ignorance?

in my view the most likely scenario is that usage of AI will simply make operations too complex for humans to understand and through interoperability issues muck up even trivial tasks. society, too complex to manage even now, will fragment and regress. again, the issue of control.

at the bottom? our superstitious belief that technological progress is ""inevitable"" -- ""it's coming, like it or not, so get used to it!"" -- has actually made it irreversible.

1235,125420513,ThomasK,"Madison, WI","One reason for which many current industry leaders might be asking the government to intervene and impose AI regulations is a lot simpler and more direct than the touted nonspecific concerns about a cognitive Frankenstein:  competitive advantage.

If you can get the government to regulate something and regulate it in a way that favors you over your competitors, you gain a competitive advantage.  So everyone suddenly wants regulation and everyone suddenly has ideas about the form such regulation ought to take.
